# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

__Dataset Source:__ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction

This dataset was originally used in one of my data analysis course projects, and I will now apply my data analysis skills to analyze the data and make predictions using different methods available in the sklearn library.

__Purpose:__

1. Use factor analysis to investigate the underlying patterns of the dataset and identify the factors that are highly correlated to the satisfaction level of US airline passengers.
2. Predict customersâ€™ level of satisfaction with: 
   - Logistic Regression (with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) pre-processing)
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis
   - Random Forest
